# Introduction

Welcome to [project-anything](https://project-anything.herokuapp.com/). This is a web-based application to be able to create audio projects.
Any user may create an account or log in through google. Afterwards, you are allowed to create a project.
Inside each project, you may add as many audio files as you like. You can then edit the tracks using our user interface.
Every edit you make is automatically saved. Futhermore, you can publish your edited project to the public. At any time, you
can change your project back to private.
